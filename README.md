YX : JS : YAPI (Yuiti's API)
============================

> A small API project using Node.js, MongoDB and Express, based on another PHP project of mine.

This is by no means a full-fledged API, but more of a training ground for me to learn how Node, Express and MongoClient work. Though it does have some basic authentication, with JSON Web Tokens in use.

You should be able to build more routes by following the same pattern in `routes/user`, just becareful, ok? ;)

Also, remember to properly setup all files in the `config`, by changing the approptiate values and removing the `.example` from the filename. :wink:
