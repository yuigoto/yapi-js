YX : JS : YAPI (Yuiti's API)
============================

> A small API project using Node.js, Mongoose and Express, based on another PHP project of mine.

This is by no means a full-fledged API, but more of a training ground for me to learn how Node, Express and Mongoose work. Though it does have some basic authentication, with JSON Web Tokens in use.

It also uses `rollup` to build an executable in commonjs syntax.

You should be able to build more routes by following the same pattern in `routes/auth`, just be careful, ok? ;)

Also, remember to properly setup all files in the `config`, by changing the appropriate values and removing the `.example` from the filename. :wink:
