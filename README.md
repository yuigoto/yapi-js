# YAPI (Yuiti's API) | JavaScript

> A small API project built using Node.js, Mongoose and Express, based on an 
old PHP project I had.

This is by no means a full-fledged API, but more of a training ground for me to 
learn more about Node.js, Express and Mongoose.

It can, I think, serve as basis for building some minimal API for small stuff, 
which is what I'm using it for now.

The API, as-is, only has some basic authentication/login (with JSON web tokens) 
and a healthcheck endpoint, so you'll have to code your own endpoints to make 
use of these, though I'm planning on putting some example endpoints to make it 
easy to know what to do.

## Docs

There's **NONE** (right now), because I'm kinda lazy (c'mon, it's almost Xmas!) 
:sweat_smile:. Check `package.json` for the available commands and the comments 
for additional instructions.
